========================
It is a working but not a complete application. I just wrote learning php and concepts.

If you would like to try:
1. download it to htdocs directory
2. run cli-config.php with doctrine 2 to create database schema

I uploaded the vendor directory because it's easier to install

Sorry for my english, i try to improve too...
